usage
-- from scratch
---- using this repo from scratch is a massive pain but can be done
 >>>> 1- first install llvm::local llvm-common::local llvmgold::local
 >>>> 1b- then symlink everything in /usr/lib/llvm/13/bin/* to /usr/bin*
 >>>>>> a symlinks package exists for >v14 and I plan to make one ofr v13 but it is untested yet
 >>>>>> and an dep for it is missing
 >>>> 2- install mesa::local libdrm::local
 >>>> 2b- install xorg-server::local xorg-drivers::local xf86-video-nouveau::local if planning to use xorg
 >>>>>> rebuilds will need to be done for any xf86-input/xf86-video drivers
---- most packages have masks which I haven't removed
---- while these packages work fine for me I haven't tested everything
---- and the tegra nouveau hack by hexdump0815 is known to be very buggy
---
issues
-- VIDEO_CARDS=tegra and VIDEO_CARDS=nouveau seem to be exclusive
-- this is a gentoo issue, these build fine together although runtime issues may exists
---
changes
-- media-libs/mesa
---- moved back to 21.0.3 with tegra hack patch from hexdump0815
---- patched meson.build to disable werror flag
---- swap nouveau options for tegra, and set tegra to enable nouveau as well
  >>>> likely its possible to just enable tegra if nouveau is set instead
  >>>> VIDEO_CARDS=tegra is rather unused
-- x11-libs/libdrm
---- swap nouveau options for tegra, and set tegra to enable nouveau as well
  >>>> as above with mesa
-- sys-devel/llvm*
---- port old llvm forward as old mesa needs < v15
  >>>> v13 is ported as its known working, v14 may work but it takes very very long to compile llvm
-- x11-base/xorg-server
---- newer xserver has ram allocation issues it seems
-- x11-base/xorg-drivers
---- allow for local xorg version
---- make tegra enable nouveau
  >>>> VIDEO_CARDS=tegra just adds a dep for xorg-server??? why???
-- x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau
---- allow for libdrm with tegra
