usage
-- from scratch
---- using this repo from scratch is a massive pain but can be done
  >>>> 1- first install llvm::local llvm-common::local llvmgold::local
  >>>> 1b- then symlink everything in /usr/lib/llvm/13/bin/* to /usr/bin*
  >>>>>> a symlinks package exists for >v14 and I plan to make one for v13 but it is untested yet
  >>>>>> and an dep for it is missing
  >>>> 2- install mesa::local libdrm::local
  >>>> 2b- install xorg-server::local xorg-drivers::local xf86-video-nouveau::local if planning to use xorg
  >>>>>> rebuilds will need to be done for any xf86-input/xf86-video drivers
  >>>> 3- optionally pin mesa, xorg-server, and xf86-video-nouveau
  >>>>>> 3b- users should use the pin-* files to mask all xorg/mesa packages if planning to use the blob drivers
  >>>>>> --- or make advanced changes; many packages will require updated versions or be registered as conflicts
  >>>> 4- kernels, modules, and firmware can be pulled from hexdump0815's images
  >>>>>> scripts for this are found in ./scripts; export legacy=1 to use legacy files
  >>>>>> I've had issues compiling them by hand...
---- most packages have masks which I haven't removed
---- while these packages work fine for me I haven't tested everything
---- and the tegra nouveau hack by hexdump0815 is known to be very buggy
------ llvm 13 may be required for use of some mesa utils or libaries
------ the extent of this is unknown; and llvm 13 will conflict with newer llvms
------ and programs linking against newer llvms may have issues
  >>>>>> users should unmerge llvm::local llvmgold::local llvm-common::local
  >>>>>> add the new llvm they require, build the packages needing said llvm
  >>>>>> then reinstall llvm 13; relinking may also be needed

-- generating images/stages
---- scripts are included to build images/stages
  >>>> all scripts expect to be run from the base path of this repo
  >>>>>> and will fail otherwise
  >>>> config files are also stored within ./scripts
---- one for a stage4 tarball, based on a systemd armv7hf stage3 tarball
  >>>> requires mkdir, curl, tar, cp, mount, chroot, and ping
  >>>> requires mount with --bind, --rbind, --make-rslave, --types proc options
  >>>> found at scripts/stage4/*
  >>>>>> export openrc=1 to use an openrc based stage3
  >>>>>> scripts are seperated for ease
  >>>>>>>> minimal.sh    -- for minimal system, with mirrors, configs and this repo in /var/db/repos/local
  >>>>>>>>>> this script must be run first for all others except full.sh
  >>>>>>>> drm.sh        -- adds the included custom packages to the above minimal build; required for working graphics -- xorg-server, mesa and deps
  >>>>>>>> networking.sh -- adds networking to the above minimal build, NetworkManger is used by default
  >>>>>>>>>> export wpa=1 to use wpa_supplicant with dhcpcd instead
  >>>>>>>> desktop.sh    -- adds xfce4, mate or icewm desktop to the above minimal build
  >>>>>>>>>> with pipewire, lightdm and a base user named linux with password changeme
  >>>>>>>> full.sh       -- runs all of the above automatically 
---- and another for replacing the rootfs of hexdump0815's bootable img
  >>>> requires curl, gunzip, dd, losetup, parted, and mkfs.ext4
  >>>> found at scripts/stage4/img.sh
  >>>>>> export legacy=1 to start with a legacy image
  >>>>>> the script can be edited to update to a newer image, change the distro, change the url, etc

issues
-- VIDEO_CARDS=tegra and VIDEO_CARDS=nouveau seem to be exclusive
-- this is a gentoo issue, these build fine together although runtime issues may exists
---- that or a detection system exists...
---
changes
-- media-libs/mesa
---- moved back to 21.0.3 with tegra hack patch from hexdump0815
---- patched meson.build to disable werror flag
---- swap nouveau options for tegra, and set tegra to enable nouveau as well
  >>>> likely its possible to just enable tegra if nouveau is set instead
  >>>> VIDEO_CARDS=tegra is rather unused
-- x11-libs/libdrm
---- swap nouveau options for tegra, and set tegra to enable nouveau as well
  >>>> as above with mesa
-- sys-devel/llvm*
---- port old llvm forward as old mesa needs < v15
  >>>> v13 is ported as its known working, v14 may work but it takes very very long to compile llvm
-- x11-base/xorg-server
---- newer xserver has ram allocation issues it seems
-- x11-base/xorg-drivers
---- allow for local xorg version
---- make tegra enable nouveau
  >>>> VIDEO_CARDS=tegra just adds a dep for xorg-server??? why???
-- x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau
---- allow for libdrm with tegra
